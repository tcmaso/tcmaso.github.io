CURRENT KNOWN BUGS TO FIX:
After using eraser tool and use another tool, fill colour is set to white instead of whatever the colour picker is on, need to reselect the colour picker to change it.
load function bug: some images do not upload and appear on screen, could be due to file type/size limit.
